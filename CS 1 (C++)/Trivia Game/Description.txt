For this assignment, you will make a file-based trivia game. 
Your program will read from a list of questions in a file called "triviaQuestions.txt" and a list of answers called "triviaAnswers.txt".
 The game will ask the user the first question. Your program will then get the user's answer and compare it with the first answer. 
Each question the user gets right will count for 1 point.
 At the end of the game, your program should output the user's score (points and percentage to two decimal places). 
The number of questions will be listed at the beginning of the triviaQuestions document, followed by the overall theme of the game. 
There will also be a file called "highScores.txt". This file will contain the top 3 scores with the accompanying name, in order.

 

An example triviaQuestions.txt file may look like this:

2 BioShock
Who created Rapture in the BioShock series?
What were the initials on the back of Booker DeWitt's hand in BioShock Infinite?

Likewise, triviaAnswers.txt will look something like this:

Andrew Ryan
AD

Finally, highScores.txt will look something like this:
10 Booker DeWitt
9 Father Comstock
8 Jack Wynand


Thus, a sample run of your program may look like this:


Welcome to the BioShock trivia game!

Question 1:

Who created Rapture in the BioShock series?

> Andrew Ryan

That is correct! You currently have 1 point.

Question 2:

What were the initials on the back of Booker DeWitt's hand in BioShock Infinite?

> Wrong Answer

I’m sorry, that is incorrect. You currently have 1 point.

Final score: 50% (1/2 correct questions)

You did not make it into the high scores list.

Current High Scores:

1. 10 Booker DeWitt
2. 9 Father Comstock
3. 8 Jack Wynand

 

This assignment will contain an extra credit portion. You may make up your own questions and answers (in any theme). 
If you create at least 10 of each, all of which follow a consistent theme and are of your own making, you will receive an extra 10% on this assignment.
