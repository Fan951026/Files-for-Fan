Due to the complexity of this problem, you'll be provided with pseudocode outlining the algorithm necessary to complete the assignment, given below:

//start program

read in coordinates

x = horizontal distance from start to finish

y = vertical distance from start to finish

numMoves = 0

listOfMoves=“”

while not at finish {

  increment numMoves

  subtract from or add to x, store direction in listOfMoves

  subtract from or add to  y, store direction in listOfMoves

}

display numMoves

display listOfMoves

//end program

 

If you would like to test your program, you are free to make an account on CodeForces and submit your solution. 
If it passes their tests, you can be sure it will pass ours.
