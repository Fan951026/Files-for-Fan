Write a class called PiggyBank that contains the following member variables:

broken
a bool indicating whether or not the piggy bank is broken
savings
a double that holds the value stored in your piggy bank
In addition, the class should contain the following member functions:

A default constructor
This constructor should set the value for the broken bool and start the bank with no money.
A regular constructor
This constructor should accept a value for an initial deposit into your bank and set the initial value of the broken bool
A destructor
The destructor should check if the piggy bank is broken and output a message if it was broken.
countSavings
This is an accessor function that should give you the amount stored in the savings variable
depositMoney
This function should accept a double and add that value to what is stored in the savings function
You can't put money into a broken piggy bank.
 Negative money deposits are not allowed
smash
smash should change the broken bool so it indicates the piggy bank is broken and return the money you have in your piggy bank.
