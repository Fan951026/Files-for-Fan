The vintage gum vending machine pictured above, allows users to insert a nickel and pull one of four tabs to dispense the pack of gum of their choice. 
For this assignment, you are to write a menu-style program that simulates this machine. 
Your program should print the following menu:

      s - report the machine status
      d - drop in a quarter
      1 - pull the 1st tab
      2 - pull the 2nd tab
      3 - pull the 3rd tab
      4 - pull the 4th tab
      r - restock the machine
      q - quit

Any other input should be met with an "I do not understand" response.

Here is an example session (user responses shown in blue):

      s - report the machine status
      d - drop in a quarter
      1 - pull the 1st tab
      2 - pull the 2nd tab
      3 - pull the 3rd tab
      4 - pull the 4th tab
      r - restock the machine
      q - quit

     So long!

You get the picture.  You are allowed to be inventive in your text and actions, as long as it makes sense within the context of the story.

Below are a couple of clarifying items for the assignment:

The price of a pack of gum is 75 cents (it’s no 5 cents but still a bargain).
The vending machine only accepts quarters.
There is no concept of a “coin return.”
If a user tries to vend an item that is out-of-stock, the vending machine will activate the vending mechanism and take the money even if there is no item to dispense.
To keep things simple, if a user deposits more than the amount needed to purchase the gum, all of that money is taken when the item is vended. 
So, for example, if a user drops a $1.50 into the machine and pulls tab 1, the machine will vend a pack of Beemans gum (provided one is available) and take the $1.50.
 The extra $0.75 is taken by the machine.
