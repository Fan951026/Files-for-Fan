Write a 2D HTML Canvas Breakout game according to the following specifications...

*Game starts with 8 rows of bricks.  When all bricks are cleared, or all paddles have been used, the game ends.
	-Each row is made up of at least 14 bricks.
	-Starting from the bottom, two rows of yellow, two rows of orange, two rows of blue, and two rows of green.
	-Have a small space between each of the rows and bricks.  Look at the sample gameplay video below for how this should look.

*Some kind of nice background image for the gameplay area.

*When starting the game, provide a 3, 2, 1 count down timer, showing the numbers 3, 2, 1 in the middle of the screen for the count down. 
 Following the completion of the countdown, the ball starts from the paddle in a nice direction (nice meaning most anything other than straight up).

*Single paddle (not two as in the sample gameplay video).
 	-The paddle shrinks to half size when the player breaks through (makes a hole) in the top green row.  
         On start of new paddle, if top row already has a hole, start with the full size paddle and then shrink to half size when a brick in the top green row is destroyed.

*Player starts with three paddles; no way to earn any more.
	-When the player doesn't hit the ball, subtract a paddle from the remaining paddles (or end the game if none left)
         and provide a 3, 2, 1 count down timer before starting with the new paddle.  Ball starts in the same way as the start of the game.

*The ball speed increases at the following intervals (start over when starting a new paddle):
	-4 bricks removed
	-12 bricks removed
	-36 bricks removed
	-62 bricks removed

*When the ball collides with the paddle, use the reflection technique discussed in this blog post: link (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

*Scoring
	-1 point for each yellow brick
	-2 points for each orange brick
	-3 points for each blue brick
	-5 points for each green brick
	-25 points when a line is cleared
	-Every 100 points the player earns a second ball that automatically starts from the middle of the paddle (no space bar to release it).

*Every time a brick is hit, a tasteful explosion of particles occurs. 
 The explosion happens by having particles take up the same space (surface area) as the brick and then explode out based upon their position relative to the center.  
 Alternatively, the explosion could be the particles falling down, with a stickiness based upon their relative position on the brick (higher in the brick, the stickier).

*User Interface : New Game, High Scores, Credits
	-In-Place menu, like my GameState example (may be HTML or Canvas rendered).  Use one or both of two menu navigation options:
		1.Up and down arrow keys to move between the menu options.  Use ESC key to back out of the High Scores and Credits screens. 
 	          When ESC is pressed during gameplay, provide a menu option for the user to resume or quit the game.
		2.Mouse selection of menu items.

*Currently selected menu choice must be clearly understood by the user (me).

*High Scores are persisted to the browser's local storage; keep and display up to the top 5 scores.

*Provide an option in the High Score display to reset the scores.

*During gameplay
	-Show current score; place at bottom of the gameplay screen.
	-Graphically (not text) show number of paddles left; place in the upper right or lower left of the gameplay screen.
