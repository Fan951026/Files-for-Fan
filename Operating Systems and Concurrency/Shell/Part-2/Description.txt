Update your shell program from Assignment 4 to support IO redirection.  
You need to support redirecting input and output to files and pipes.

 

The input to an executable can be from a file using this syntax:

foo < infilename

 

The output from a executable can be redirected to a file using this syntax:

foo > outfilename

 

The output from an executable can be redirected to the input of a second using this syntax:

foo | bar

 

These three operations can be chained to an arbitrary depth.  For example:

A < infilename | B | C | D > outfilename
