Part - 1:
Write a simulator for exploring different CPU and Memory scheduling algorithms. 

At a minimum your simulator must be able to vary the following parameters:

-Task mix - The percentage of CPU vs I/O bound processes
-Task frequency - The rate at which new processes are added to the system
-Number of CPUs
-Number of unique I/O Devices
-Cost of a context switch
At a minimum your simulator must be able to measure the following statistics:

-Response Time - Time from process creation to first I/O completion
-Latency - Time from process creation to final CPU completion
-Throughput - Number of completed processes per unit time
-Efficiency - Percentage of time spent with CPUs occupied with useful work (context switching does not count)

Use your simulator to explore FIFO process scheduling. Include a report of your findings.
Include a readme file that explains how to run your simulator and set parameters for an experiment. 
Future assignments will extend the number of scheduling algorithms and the number of parameters so be flexible in your implementation.

//============================================================================
Part - 2: 

Add Round Robin, Shortest Job First, and Approximate Shortest Job First scheduling to your simulator. 
 Design an experiment and report on your findings as before.

//============================================================================
Part - 3:

Add memory to your scheduler.  Also add the following memory scheduling algorithms:

-FIFO
-Most Recently Used
-Least Recently Used
-Second Chance
Add the following parameters

-Size of cache (memory)
-Cache miss penalty
-Page distributions

Page distribution can be as simple as a number of pages, then draw uniformly.


As before submit a report of your findings.
