Write a parallel version of quicksort and linear search.  Run with 2-8 threads in the thread pool.
  Use std::sort and std::find as your serial algorithm to compare with for speedup. 
 Search and sort vectors of 100 to 1,000,000 elements (use a log scale). 
 Include a report of timing, speedup, and efficiency.
