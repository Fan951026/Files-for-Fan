Write a class to represent rational numbers.  Unlike floating point numbers, rational numbers do not suffer from finite precision.  
The numbers should be stored in their simplest form. The following operations are required:

Casting: Rational numbers should be able to be  cast to floats and double, and  cast from integers.

Comparison: All of the comparison operators <, > , == , <= , >= . != should be implemented

Arithmetic:  All of the arithmetic operators, +, +=, *, *=, /, /= -, -= should be implemented

I/O: Stream insertion and extraction << and >> should be implemented

 

You must also provide a main program that demonstrates the full capability of your rational number class.
