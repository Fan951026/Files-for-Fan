Write a the following sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Write a program that times these algorithms on random data of various sizes.  Also time the performance of std::sort.  
You can use the std::chrono library for timing and std::random for generating data.

 

Write a short report (1-2 paragraphs + a graph of time v. size of the algorithms) showing your results.
