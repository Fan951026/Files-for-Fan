Created a linked list template class that maintains all of its elements in sorted order.  
The linked list must be able to contain any type (it is a template).  In addition it must support the following:

Insert an element (list must stay in sorted order - this is the equivalent of an amortized insertion sort)
Remove an element (remove all elements in list with a given value - template type must be equality comparable)
A size function that returns the number of elements in the list
Copy construction - this must be a deep copy
Copy assignment - this must be a deep copy
Move construction - this must be a shallow copy
Move assignment - this must be a shallow copy
A for each function - invokes an arbitrary function (given as a parameter) on each element in the list
Additionally you must write a program that demonstrates that your linked list class meets all requirements.
